## Hi, :wave: I'm David

:gift_heart: Welcome to my profile :clap:

I’m a mathematics teacher who’s obsessed with the analytical applications of the subject. I’ve been teaching for ten years now, and every year I develop a rationale for every strand, which pushes my students to not only memorize the facts and definitions but also develop analytical skills in solving problems. Ultimately, my favorite part of my job is to maintain and analyze their data as they progress and pursue careers related to mathematics. For me, the added role of school data administrator, analyzing students’ performances is the highlight of my day. For this reason, after a serious self-reflection, I started to consider becoming a data analyst. My current career path only entails partial data management and analysis, and I want to switch to a job where I can fully write codes to discover insights in data for the decision-making process, one that will challenge and thrill me. I chose this industry because I love working with computers and have a passion for data analysis, and having completed a **Nanodegree program in Data Analysis from Udacity**, I believe the skills I have gained are valuable for this new role. I want to continue honing those skills.
