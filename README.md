## Hi, :wave: I'm David

:gift_heart: Welcome to my profile :clap:

As the Head of Academics at Kombeni Girls, a high school that offers quality education to girls from diverse backgrounds, I lead the development and implementation of effective curricula that foster analytical thinking and problem-solving skills among my students. I also manage and analyze the school's data on students' performance, attendance, and retention, using various tools such as SQL, Python, and Excel. I have over 10 years of experience in teaching mathematics and statistics, and I am passionate about using data to improve educational outcomes and opportunities.

To enhance my data analysis skills and knowledge, I have pursued several online courses and certifications, including a Nanodegree program in Data Analysis from Udacity, where I learned how to use data to answer real-world questions, create visualizations, and communicate insights. I have also completed courses on Python programming, Excel fundamentals, and R programming, and I have a certificate in Associate Data Analyst in SQL from DataCamp. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a full-time data analyst role, where I can leverage my experience in education and statistics to provide valuable insights and solutions for data-driven organizations.
